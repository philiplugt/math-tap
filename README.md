### Details
This is project is based on a game I used to play in the morning at school for warming up your brain. Someone would start counting and everyone would clap once for multiples of 3 *or* 5, and twice for multiple of 3 *and* 5. I have fond memories of it, and wanted to create something in honor of that. In absence of clapping, I added a big red button to my app to make the experience tactile and tangible.
